# Bold chat Queue

When user starts a bold chat session, until an agent is assigned to the user's chat and accept it, the chat can be added to a queue.
 
When previous chats will end the user's chat will be promoted in the queue until position 0, means the chat is no longer in the queue and the chat is waiting for agent acceptance.

> User can end the chat while in the queue with [life cycle `ChatState`](https://developer.bold360.com/help/EN/Bold360API/Bold360API/c_sdk_combined_ios_adv_chat_lifecycle.html) (`ChatInQueue`) or while waiting for acceptance (`ChatPending`). 
The user will be presented with unavailability form if enabled otherwise a message.
