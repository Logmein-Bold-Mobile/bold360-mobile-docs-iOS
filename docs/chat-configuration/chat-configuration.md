## Overview
Chat features are configured by the various consoles available for every chat type, and by the SDKs pre defined available options.  
Chat configurations can be controlled by the embbeding App, by using the `ChatConfiguration` object called as `viewConfiguration` on the `ChatController`.

```swift
let chatConfig = Bold360AI.ChatConfiguration()
/* do some custom change */
