## Overview
Through chat progress, it can be in various states, each has it's own meaning. The hosting app can react to chat states and control it's flow, by listening to chat states changes.   
{: .overview}
In order to listen to chat lifecycle events, set your implemention of `ChatEventListener`, to the `ChatController`.

```kotlin
// on ChatController construction:
val chatController = ChatController.Builder(context)
                        .chatEventListener(listener)...build(...)

// or later in time:
chatController.chatEventListener = listener
```

        switch (stateEvent.getState()) {
            case StateEvent.Started:
