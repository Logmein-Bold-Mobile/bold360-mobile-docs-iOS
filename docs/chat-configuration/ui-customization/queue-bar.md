## Overview
On live chat creation, if all available agents are occupied to their capacity, the chat will be added to a waiting queue.
The chat will be promoted in the queue, until position 0, indicating that the chat is no longer in the queue and is waiting for an agent acceptance.
{: .overview}

While in [queue state]({{'/docs/chat-configuration/tracking-events/chat-lifecycle#inqueue' | relative_url}}), the user can choose to cancel the chat.   
Chat canceling is handled as unavailable, and the user will be presented with unavailability form or message, according to the chat window configurations.
