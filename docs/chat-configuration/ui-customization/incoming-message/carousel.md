## Carousel Item
Each corousel item consists of three display sections: 
- **Image**<sub>Optional</sub> - Can be configured with a url link, on the admin console. If image was not set, a default image will be displayed.
- **Info**<sub>Mandatory</sub> - Consist of a Title and an optional subtitle
- **Options**<sub>Optional</sub> - Item options .

## UI configurations
The carousel UI can be customized, by overriding the `CarouselItemsUIProvider.configure` method and/or the `CarouselItemsUIProvider.customize` method for [dynamic data related customizations]({{'/docs/chat-configuration/ui-cutomization/how-it-works#customize' | relative_url}}).   
The available configuration proprties can be found in `CarouselItemsUIAdapter`.

### General item configurations
- Use `CarouselItemsUIAdapter.setCardStyle` method to configure the carousel item display. 
    - `elevation` level - level of 0, makes a flat look, while greater values sets a card look to the items.
    - Rounded corners - defined by a radius level. Value of 0 makes squere corners. 

  >_**Notice**, If a card style display is configured, items background should not be transparent!_

- Carousel items consist of 3 display sections: info, image and options. The sections display order, can be configured with `CarouselItemsUIAdapter.setInfoTextAlignment`, defaults to `CarouselItemConfiguration.ItemInfoAlignment.AlignBelowThumb`

### Info section
Info section contains a title and a sub-title, which are configured with minimum line number of 1 and 2 lines respectfully.   
Minimum line number can be configured with `setInfoTitleMinLines` and `setInfoSubTitleMinLines` methods.
The minimun height for this section will be calulated according to the line number values.   
The sub-title height is flexible and may stretch to the maximum available item height.

> Additional info section configurations can be found in `CarouselItemsUIAdapter`. See methods prefixed with `setInfo`.

### Options section
Item options are contained in a non-scrollable vertical order layout.  
The options, text alignment and look are configurable.

All options are configured to the same line count, defaults to 1 line.   
Use `CarouselItemsContainer.setOptionsLineCount` method to change the line count.

> Carousel view height is being calculated according to the item with the maximum number of options.

### Image section
Image size is constant. 
If a link is configured for the image, it will be passed to the hosting App, on user press action, for further handling, via [`ChatEventListener.onUrlLinkSelected` implementation]({{'/docs/chat-configuration/tracking-events/events-and-notifications#listening-to-url-navigation' | relative_url}}).

## UI override
Carousel list section can be override by overriding `CarouselItemsUIProvider.overrideFactory` property.    
A customed implementation of `CarouselItemsAdapter` should be provided by the overriding factory.

```kotlin
ChatUIProvider(context).apply {
    this.chatElementsUIProvider.incomingUIProvider.carouselUIProvider.overrideFactory =
            object : CarouselItemsUIProvider.CarouselFactory {
                override fun createItemsAdapter(context: Context): CarouselItemsAdapter {
                    return MyCarouselImplementation();
                }
    }
}
```
